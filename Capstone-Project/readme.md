Project Overview:
You areee a Data Engineer at Y Company.

This capstone project aims to build a robust data engineering pipeline that ingests real-time data streams, processes them, and stores them in a data warehouse. 
The processed data can then be used for real-time analytics and business intelligence.

Data Source:

Real-time data streams: Social media feeds (Twitter, Instagram), IoT device data, or financial market data.
Batch data: Historical data from databases or data lakes.

Technology Stack:

Data Ingestion: Apache Kafka, Pub/sub, or Google Dataflow,Apache Nifi
Data Processing: Apache Spark, Apache Beam, or Google Cloud Function
Data Storage: Data warehouses like BigQuery, or data lakes like Databricks or deltalake 
Cloud Platform: GCP
Project Steps:

Data Ingestion:

Set up a data ingestion pipeline to continuously capture real-time data streams.
Use tools like Kafka or pubsub vs to ingest data from various sources.
Ensure data reliability and fault tolerance by implementing error handling and retry mechanisms.
Data Processing:

Process the ingested data using tools like Spark .
Clean, transform, and enrich the data as needed.
Perform real-time aggregations, calculations, and feature engineering.
Implement data quality checks and validation.
Data Storage:

Store the processed data in a data warehouse or data lake.
Use partitioning and indexing techniques to optimize query performance.
Consider using Delta Lake or Hudi for efficient data updates and time travel capabilities.

Real-time Analytics:

Set up real-time analytics dashboards using tools like Tableau,  or Looker vs
Create visualizations to monitor key metrics and trends.
Implement alerting mechanisms to notify stakeholders of critical events.
Additional Considerations:

Security: Implement robust security measures to protect sensitive data.
Scalability: Design the pipeline to handle increasing data volumes and processing needs.
Monitoring and Logging: Monitor the pipeline's performance and troubleshoot issues.
Cost Optimization: Optimize resource utilization to minimize costs.
Data Governance: Establish data governance policies to ensure data quality and compliance.
By successfully completing this project, you will demonstrate your ability to design, build, and maintain a complex data engineering pipeline, making you a valuable asset in the data engineering field.
